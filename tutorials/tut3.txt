Tutorial 3 Q2

Consider the following columnated (space-delimited) data file containing contact information for various academic staff:

G Keller       Newtown      9381-1234
W H Wilson     Kingsford    9621-1234
A Mahidadia    Randwick     9663-1234
R Buckland     Randwick     9663-9876
J A Shepherd   Botany       9665-4321
A Taylor       Glebe        9692-1234
M Pagnucco     North Ryde   9868-6789

The data is currently sorted in phone number order. Can we use the sort filter to re-arrange the data into "telephone-book" order? 
If not, how would we need to change the file in order to achieve this?

Ans: We can use the sort filter AFTER we do some transformation to the text file. The reason we cannot sort it immediately with sort
is because each person's surname appears on a different column. For example G Keller, Keller appears on the second column and
J A Shepherd, Shepherd appears on the 3rd column. 

We need to make sure the surname appears on the same field on each line. For example,

G Keller       Newtown      9381-1234
W.H. Wilson     Kingsford    9621-1234
A Mahidadia    Randwick     9663-1234
R Buckland     Randwick     9663-9876
J.A. Shepherd   Botany       9665-4321
A Taylor       Glebe        9692-1234
M Pagnucco     North Ryde   9868-6789

This can be achieved using the pipeline

cat | sed -r 's/^(([A-Z]) ([A-Z]) /\1\.\2\. ' | sort -k2
